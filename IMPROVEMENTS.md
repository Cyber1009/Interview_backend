# Project Structure Improvements

This document outlines the structural improvements made to the Interview Backend application and provides instructions on how to complete the migration.

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated Security Components**
   - Moved and enhanced security functions from `app/security.py` to `app/core/security/auth.py`
   - Ensured bcrypt compatibility fix is properly applied in `app/core/security/bcrypt_fix.py`

2. **Streamlined Configuration Management**
   - Consolidated settings from `app/config.py` to `app/core/config.py`
   - Updated all imports to reference the core configuration

3. **Restructured Database Components**
   - Consolidated database functions from `app/database.py` to `app/core/database/db.py`
   - Moved models from `app/models.py` to `app/core/database/models.py`

4. **Improved Package Organization**
   - Added informative `__init__.py` files to enhance module discoverability
   - Created clear domain separation in schema organization
   - Updated imports throughout the application for consistency

5. **Added Documentation**
   - Created `structure.md` outlining the new project structure
   - Added this improvements guide

## Completing the Migration

Follow these steps to complete the migration and test the improved structure:

### 1. Run the Cleanup Script

This will back up and remove the old files that have been consolidated:

```bash
python cleanup.py
```

### 2. Test the Application 

Run the application to ensure everything works with the new structure:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

You should be able to access the API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### 3. Verify Functionality

Test key API endpoints to ensure they still function properly:
- Authentication endpoints
- Interview management endpoints
- Candidate endpoints
- Payment processing endpoints

### 4. Update Deployment Configuration

If you're using Heroku, your Procfile should already be pointing to `app.main:app`. If not, update it to:

```
web: uvicorn app.main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=${PORT:-8000}
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and domain-driven organization
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate code and configuration
3. **Improved Discoverability**: Better package structure makes code easier to navigate
4. **Future-Proofing**: API versioning and modular structure makes future upgrades easier
5. **Enhanced Documentation**: Clear project structure documentation

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after the migration:

1. Check for import errors: Look for imports still referencing the old file structure
2. Verify that all functionality in the backed-up files was properly migrated
3. Restore any necessary files from the backup directory created by the cleanup script
