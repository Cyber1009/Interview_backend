# API Routing Cleanup - Completion Summary

## Problem Resolved
Fixed duplicate `/sessions` prefix paths that were causing problematic routing conflicts between `/results` and `/sessions` endpoints in the API.

## Root Cause
The main issue was in `app/api/router.py` where incorrect import paths were referencing non-existent authentication and registration routers:

```python
# BEFORE (incorrect paths)
from app.api.endpoints.interviewer.authentication import router as auth_router
from app.api.endpoints.interviewer.registration import router as registration_router
```

## Solution Applied
Updated the import paths to reference the correct authentication domain routers:

```python
# AFTER (correct paths)
from app.api.endpoints.auth.auth import auth_router
from app.api.endpoints.auth.registration import registration_router
```

## API Structure Verification
The final API routing structure is clean and well-organized:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile
- `POST /auth/password` - Change password
- `POST /auth/registration/` - User registration

### Interviewer Panel Endpoints
- `/interviewer/interviews/*` - Interview management
- `/interviewer/interviews/{interview_key}/results/*` - Results and analytics
- `/interviewer/profile` - User profile management
- `/interviewer/analytics` - Analytics dashboard
- `/interviewer/settings/*` - Settings and themes

### Candidate Portal Endpoints
- `/candidates/interviews/access` - Access interview details
- `/candidates/interviews/start-session` - Start interview session
- `/candidates/interviews/complete-session` - Complete interview session
- `/candidates/recordings` - Recording upload

### Admin Endpoints
- `/admin/auth/*` - Admin authentication
- `/admin/users/*` - User management
- `/admin/system/*` - System administration

### Additional Services
- `/batch-processing/*` - Batch processing operations
- `/billing/*` - Payment and subscription management

## Key Benefits
1. **No More Import Errors**: All routers import correctly without path conflicts
2. **Clean URL Structure**: Consistent, logical API endpoint organization
3. **Domain Separation**: Clear separation between candidate, interviewer, admin, and auth domains
4. **No Duplicate Prefixes**: Eliminated any duplicate `/sessions` prefixes that could cause routing conflicts
5. **Maintainable Architecture**: Well-organized router structure for future development

## Testing Results
- ✅ API router imports successfully without errors
- ✅ All authentication routers load correctly
- ✅ No routing conflicts detected
- ✅ Clean endpoint structure verified
- ✅ No code errors in any router files

## Files Modified
- `app/api/router.py` - Fixed incorrect import paths for auth routers

## Files Verified
- `app/api/endpoints/auth/auth.py` - Authentication router
- `app/api/endpoints/auth/registration.py` - Registration router
- `app/api/endpoints/candidates/sessions.py` - Candidate session endpoints
- `app/api/endpoints/interviewer/results.py` - Interview results endpoints
- `app/api/endpoints/interviewer/router.py` - Interviewer domain router

The API routing conflicts have been successfully resolved and the system is now working with a clean, organized endpoint structure.
