3. **Added Token Usage Calculation**
   - ✅ Implemented comprehensive token tracking in AnalysisService
   - ✅ Tracks prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total usage
   - ✅ Calculates estimated costs based on model pricing
   - ✅ Displays per-API-call and session-total token usage
   - ✅ Added token usage summary to test output

4. **Cleaned Up Test Files**
   - ✅ Moved test_results folder to `tests/test_results/`
   - ✅ Updated test file paths accordingly
   - ✅ Replaced corrupted `test_session_flow.py` with enhanced version
   - ✅ Removed redundant test files

5. **Enhanced Segment Data Utilization**
   - ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Analysis service DOES utilize Whisper segment data
   - ✅ Implements `_analyze_speech_timing()` method using segments
   - ✅ Calculates pause analysis, speaking continuity scores
   - ✅ Includes timing metrics in OpenAI analysis prompt
   - ✅ Provides speech pattern insights (pauses, continuity, fluency)

## 📊 Current Test Results

**Latest Test Run (2025-06-06 21:46:02):**
- ✅ 4/4 videos transcribed successfully
- ✅ Total words: 185
- ✅ Analysis completed with score: 6/10
- ✅ Hiring recommendation: "requires_review"
- ✅ Token usage: 1,802 total tokens, ~$0.0307 cost
- ✅ Results saved to `tests/test_results/`

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Token Usage Tracking
```python
# Now tracks in AnalysisService:
- Prompt tokens: 1,167
- Completion tokens: 635  
- Total tokens: 1,802
- Estimated cost: $0.0307
- API calls: 2 (with cumulative tracking)
```

### Segment Data Analysis
```python
# Whisper segments are used for:
- Pause analysis (timing between segments)
- Speaking continuity scoring (0-10 scale)
- Speech pattern metrics
- Fluency assessment
- All included in OpenAI analysis prompt
```

### Auto-Discovery Features
```python
# Test automatically finds:
- Video files: .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv, .webm
- Questions file: tests/test_video/questions.txt
- Matches: A1.mp4 ↔ Q1, A2.mp4 ↔ Q2, etc.
```

## 🚀 Key Features Working

1. **End-to-End Flow**: Videos → Transcription → Analysis → Results ✅
2. **Whisper Integration**: Local transcription with segment data ✅  
3. **OpenAI Analysis**: GPT-4 analysis with structured output ✅
4. **Token Tracking**: Comprehensive usage and cost calculation ✅
5. **Auto-Discovery**: Dynamic file and question loading ✅
6. **Segment Utilization**: Speech timing analysis from Whisper ✅

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Transcription**: ~1.5s per video (local Whisper)
- **Analysis**: ~21s for 4-video session (OpenAI API)
- **Token Efficiency**: 1,802 tokens for comprehensive analysis
- **Cost**: ~$0.03 per session analysis
- **Success Rate**: 100% (4/4 videos processed)

## 🎯 Answer to Your Questions

### 1. Test Results Folder Location
**✅ FIXED**: Updated test to save results in `tests/test_results/` directory as requested.

### 2. Segment Data Utilization  
**✅ CONFIRMED**: The analysis service DOES utilize Whisper's segment data extensively:

- **`_analyze_speech_timing()`** method processes segment timestamps
- **Calculates pause analysis**: Number of pauses, average duration, longest pause
- **Speech continuity scoring**: 0-10 scale based on speaking vs. pause ratio
- **Fluency metrics**: Segment duration patterns, speaking rate consistency
- **Integrated in prompt**: All timing data included in OpenAI analysis request

The segment data provides rich insights about:
- Speech patterns and fluency
- Confidence and hesitation (via pause analysis)
- Communication style (continuous vs. fragmented)
- Overall speaking rhythm and pacing

This timing analysis enhances the interview evaluation beyond just content analysis.
