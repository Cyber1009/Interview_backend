FULL TRANSCRIPT
------------------------------
 Hello, my name's Kate. Thank you for clicking on to the video to get to know me a little bit better. I guess what I wanted to say to you today was one of the reasons that drove me to apply to your organisation rather than some others, I really liked on your web page that you have some great core values which I feel are aligned with myself and not only that but behind those core values you're doing a lot of work in helping the community and that's the sort of company I would like to be involved with. Thank you.
