 And would you be interested in upgrading the skills you currently have as they relate to the programs mentioned in our job ad? Well, I chose to stay at home and raise my three children until they were of school age, but I'd look forward to any upgrading that's available, and I could even fit in some online courses on the weekends. Sure. I know that my work in AS 400 is still current, but I look forward to updating what I've done in ERP applications.

 So those are the main questions that we have for you, but do you have any questions for us, Barbara? I understand that this is a contract position, but are there chances that it could evolve into full-time work? I'm ready to return to the workforce and take on long-term work. My youngest is in JK, but we've arranged to cover all of our child care needs.
